These are some examples of configuration files and plugins.

* empty.conf is a configuration file that doesn't load any plugins whatsoever.
  Thus, the only available path is /hydra-admin (you can create dynamic heads
  from that web UI)

* just-tests.conf loads a single plugin with only tests (no default heads). Go
  to /hydra-admin to see the tests, start them, and see the list of available
  heads depending on the current running test

To use these examples, call Hydra like so:

    $ hydra -I examples/plugins examples/just-tests.conf
