RoboHydra sample plugins
------------------------

These are some examples of configuration files and plugins. To use
them, call RoboHydra like so:

    $ robohydra -I examples/plugins examples/just-tests.conf


Description
-----------

* empty.conf is a configuration file that doesn't load any plugins
  whatsoever.  Thus, the only available path is /robohydra-admin (you
  can create dynamic heads from that web UI)

* just-tests.conf loads a single plugin with only tests (no default
  heads). Go to /robohydra-admin to see the tests, start them, and see
  the list of available heads depending on the current running test

* logger.conf loads 'logger', a simple logging plugin that will save
  all traffic to robohydra.log in the current directory. This plugin
  can be loaded together with any other plugins to ease debugging.

* no-caching.conf loads 'no-caching', a sample plugin that tweaks
  client requests to remove caching headers. It also loads 'logger' so
  it's easy to see the effects on the requests. By default it does so
  for all paths, but you can specify a custom path calling RoboHydra
  as "robohydra -I examples/plugins examples/no-caching.conf
  nocachingpath=/foo"

* replayer.conf loads 'replayer', a simple plugin to record and replay
  requests (useful to, say, record how the server behaved at a certain
  point, then replay the requests to reproduce the problem while
  offline). To use it, you have to start RoboHydra as "robohydra -I
  examples/plugins examples/replayer.conf
  replayerurl=http://myserver.example.com". Then, visit the URL
  /start-recording when you want to start recording and visit whatever
  URLs you want (RoboHydra will proxy to the "replayerurl"). When you
  have the requests recorded, visit /start-replaying to stop recording
  and start replaying those requests. All recorded requests are in
  robohydra-replayer.json, so you can keep the file around and replay
  whenever you want.
