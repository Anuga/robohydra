RoboHydra HTTP client test tool
===============================

RoboHydra is a web server designed to help you test any kind of
HTTP-based client. It could be a GUI that uses a public API, a mobile
application that communicates with some server in order to retrieve
information, a complex Javascript front-end application that uses the
server mostly as a data store, or many other things.

In these situations, RoboHydra allows you to easily make custom "mock"
servers with little effort, be it to build a test suite, easily
reproduce problems while fixing bugs, or to help with exploratory
testing.

RoboHydra is easy to configure to return the responses you want,
mimicking any server behaviour needed to test your clients. Examples
of this might be:

* Testing how the client behaves when it receives a certain
combination of valid (but possibly uncommon or cumbersome to
reproduce) data.

* Being able to easily reproduce race conditions.

* Checking how the client behaves when the server returns Internal
Server Error or invalid data.

* Simulating server connection latency when connecting to a real
server.

For more information about the different ways in which you can use
RoboHydra, have a look at the [use cases](usecases).

Screencasts
===========

You can see all screencasts in the [RoboHydra YouTube
channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/robohydra/videos). For
more in-depth information see the tutorials and the reference
documentation in the "[Documentation](#documentation)" section below.

This has an introduction to RoboHydra and an example of how to use it
to test a client of a public API
([memegenerator.net](http://version1.api.memegenerator.net/) in this
case):

This is about using RoboHydra to develop web application front-ends,
and shows how to make a simple plugin from scratch:

Documentation
=============

To get started, go read the [basic tutorial](tutorial) and the more
[advanced tutorial](tutorial/advanced). You will also find examples in
the [use cases](usecases) section.

You also have [reference documentation](documentation) available. The
sources don't have embedded documentation (yet), but most of what you
need is described in the pages above, and the rest you can read in the
[sources](https://github.com/operasoftware/robohydra) themselves
(they're still small and easy to understand).

Download
========

You can get the [code on
GitHub](https://github.com/operasoftware/robohydra), or install
RoboHydra via NPM with the following command:

    npm install robohydra
