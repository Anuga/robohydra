RoboHydra HTTP client test tool
===============================

RoboHydra is a web server designed to help you test any kind of
HTTP-based client. It could be a GUI that uses a public API, a mobile
application that communicates with some server in order to retrieve
information, a complex Javascript front-end application that uses the
server mostly as a data store, or many other things.

In these situations, RoboHydra allows you to easily make custom "mock"
servers with little effort, be it to build a test suite, easily
reproduce problems while fixing bugs, or to help with exploratory
testing. These capabilities can _also_ be combined with proxying in
several useful ways (eg. helping web developers write the front-end
code for a project without the need to install a full backend; see the
[second screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR-XDogJ8b8) for an
example of this).

RoboHydra is easy to configure to return the responses you want,
mimicking any server behaviour needed to test your clients. Examples
of this might be:

* Testing how the client behaves when it receives a certain
combination of valid (but possibly uncommon or cumbersome to
reproduce) data.

* Being able to easily reproduce race conditions.

* Checking how the client behaves when the server returns Internal
Server Error or invalid data.

* Simulating server connection latency when connecting to a real
server.

For more information about the different ways in which you can use
RoboHydra, have a look at the [use cases](usecases) and the
[screencasts](http://www.youtube.com/user/robohydra/videos).

Screencasts
===========

You can see all screencasts in the [RoboHydra YouTube
channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/robohydra/videos). For
more in-depth information see the tutorials and the reference
documentation in the "[Documentation](#documentation)" section below.

This has an introduction to RoboHydra and an example of how to use it
to test a client of a public API
([memegenerator.net](http://version1.api.memegenerator.net/) in this
case):

client testing</iframe>

This is about using RoboHydra to develop web application front-ends,
and shows how to make a simple plugin from scratch:

This one shows the plugins that come with the RoboHydra distribution:
replayer (a plugin to record and replay data from a real server),
logger (a detailed log file generator), and no-caching (removes client
caching headers before processing requests):

Documentation
=============

To get started, go read the [basic tutorial](tutorial) and the more
[advanced tutorial](tutorial/advanced). You will also find examples in
the [use cases](usecases) section.

[Dev Opera](http://dev.opera.com) published three articles on
RoboHydra that serve as tutorials for different RoboHydra use cases:

1. [Robohydra: a new testing tool for client-server
interactions](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/robohydra-a-new-testing-tool-for-client-server-interactions/)
serves as a general introduction and covers how to build a simple
development proxy for front-end developers.

2. [Using RoboHydra as a mock
server](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/using-robohydra-as-a-mock-server/)
covers how to use RoboHydra to build mock servers that help you
reproduce bugs and build a functional testsuite.

3. [RoboHydra: advanced
techniques](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/robohydra-advanced-techniques/)
covers advanced techniques that can be applied to any kind of
RoboHydra server.

You also have [reference documentation](documentation) available. The
sources don't have embedded documentation (yet), but most of what you
need is described in the pages above, and the rest you can read in the
[sources](https://github.com/operasoftware/robohydra) themselves
(they're still small and easy to understand).

Download
========

You can get the [code on
GitHub](https://github.com/operasoftware/robohydra), or install
RoboHydra via NPM with the following command:
