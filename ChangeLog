Version 0.3
-----------

	* Potentially breaking change: assertion failures won't throw
	exceptions from now on. Instead, they will simply return
	false. This means that code after a failed assertion *does get
	executed* in RoboHydra 0.3. Most of the time this is exactly what
	you want. Moreover, it's much easier to simulate the old behaviour
	in RoboHydra 0.3, in the very few cases you might need it, than
	simulate the new behaviour with RoboHydra 0.2.

	* Streaming support: calls to the "write" method will be written
	immediately, even when chaining requests (when setup
	properly). This allows sending data in chunks, or sending data and
	never close the connection. Check the new "chain" and "on" methods
	in the Response class documentation for details.

	* Compact configuration: plugins with no special configuration can
	be specified in configuration files as a simple string (the plugin
	name), as opposed to a Javascript object with the keys "name" and
	"config".

	* New request class: you can use it to create new, fake requests
	(eg. when chaining).

	* Query (GET) parameters: the "getParams" property is deprecated
	now, in favour of "queryParams".

	* New RoboHydraHeadFilter head: this new head allows you to filter
	the result of a any matching request and return a different
	response. It understands compression and will transparently
	uncompress and compress back any compressed responses. See the
	documentation for more details.

	* New RoboHydraHeadWatchdog head: it allows you to watch the
	traffic for a certain pattern, and act when that pattern is
	found. For example, you might want to log responses containing a
	given text separately. It will transparently uncompress to make it
	easier to inspect response bodies.

	* Make heads more strict: heads will complain now about any
	properties they don't understand.

	* Admin UI: now filesystem and proxy heads can be created
	dynamically from the web UI; URL paths for dynamically-created
	static content heads will now match GET parameters; the path
	debugger will now highlight *all* matching heads, not just the
	first one; the admin plugin is not shown on the list of heads
	anymore (see the source for details if you really want to show
	them).

	* RoboHydraFilesystemHead: support index files now. See
	documentation for details.

	* RoboHydraFilesystemHead and RoboHydraProxyHead: "mountPath" is
	now treated as a plain string, meaning any special regexp
	characters must not be escaped from the mount path.

	* HTTPS: RoboHydra can now receive HTTPS requests, and
	RoboHydraProxyHead can connect to HTTPS websites.

	* Exceptions: if a head throws an exception, it will be caught and
	the request will return a 500 internal server error with the
	stacktrace as the response body.
